# The Bridge Pattern

## Concepts :
- decouple abstraction and implementation
- changes in the abstraction won't affect the client

### Examples :
- JDBC driver
---
## Design :
- the application is designed to accept changes from both sides

- consist of :
    - Abstraction
    - Implementor
    - Refined Abstraction
    - concrete Implementation
