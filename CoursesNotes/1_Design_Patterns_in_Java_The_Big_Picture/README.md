## summary + tips :
  
### Tips for using patterns
- **if you are not careful patterns can complicate things by :**
    - adding unnecessarily layers of objects 
    - or implementing overkilling solutions
    

- Note : this is called _**pattern abuse**_
---

###_**When to use a pattern ?**_
- always start from the simplest code that can do the job :
     - use patterns if you think it is necessarily to solve the problem
     - use them if you  will deal with changes in the future


    it is a matter of knowledge and experience  

----
#### Tips for implementing Patterns :
- use meaningful names for classes and methods
- practice refactoring (improving the structure without changing the behaviour)
