# The Flyweight Pattern
###### flyWeight object shares the intrinsic state, and the extrinsic state is passed to it which help you to save memory  

- you can use the flyweight object in different places as if it is different objects


## How to implement ?
- before creating a new object
    - if you have an object of the needed type return it
        - else create it, store it and return it
  

- if you have different classes
     - create a factory class that contain a list of the flyweight objects
